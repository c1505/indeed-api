working with the indeed api in order to eventually add it to the jobs application

I am looking for a developer job and I want to better organize my search.  I made a ruby application with the sinatra framework for this purpose, but haven't been using
it and have just been using a spreadsheet to track my job search.

I want to work with the api so I can pull in job information automatically.  I
don't want to have to copy and paste so much stuff into either a spreadsheet
or an application.  

I am going to test drive this application.

## Problem
I want to be able to add indeed posting data to a ruby application without having to copy and paste.

## Desired Outcome(I think)
Pull down all posts given a search location and a search term.

## Interesting or fun things
I am enjoying TDD.  I haven't been in the practice of it.  Mostly writing tests after the fact if at all.  It does really make me think differently to write the tests first and I write different tests than I would otherwise.  I think I write better tests.
