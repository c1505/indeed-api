working with the indeed api in order to eventually add it to the jobs application

I am looking for a developer job and I want to better organize my search.  I made a ruby application with the sinatra framework for this purpose, but haven't been using
it and have just been using a spreadsheet to track my job search.

I want to work with the api so I can pull in job information automatically.  I 
don't want to have to copy and paste so much stuff into either a spreadsheet
or an application.  

I am going to test drive this application.
